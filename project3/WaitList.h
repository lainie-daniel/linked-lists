1. Add a new Appointment request to the list. (It will be inserted in order.)
2. View the entire list of Appointments, in the order they are stored.
3. Remove a personâ€™s appointment because they have found an appointment at another
location. This will use the find function, and both will take a string which is the name of
the patient.
4. Learn the number of people waiting in line.
5. See the wait time for the person waiting the longest. (This person should be at the front
of the line.)
6. See the average wait time for everyone in the list.
7. Identify the oldest person in the list.
8. Identify the youngest person in the list.
9. See the average age of those waiting.
